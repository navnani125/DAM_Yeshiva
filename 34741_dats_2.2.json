The goal of the project was to expand knowledge about the types of abuse experiences youth have, the extent of victimization and perpetration via technology and new media (e.g., social networking sites, texting on cellular phones), and how the experience of such cyber abuse within teen dating relationships or through bullying relates to other life factors.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis project carried out a multi-state study of teen dating violence and abuse, and bullying, the main component of which included a survey of youth from ten schools in five school districts in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, gathering information from 5,647 youth about their experiences. The study employed a cross-sectional, survey research design, collecting data via a paper-pencil survey. The survey targeted all youth who attended school on a single day and achieved an 84 percent response rate.\n</p>","types":[{"information":{"value":"survey data","@type":"Annotation"},"@type":"DataType"}],"availability":"Unable to determine availability of this dataset version.","distributions":[{"storedIn":{"name":"Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research","types":[{"value":"primary resource","@type":"Annotation"}],"@type":"DataRepository"},"dates":[{"date":"2015-12-25T15:24:22Z","type":{"value":"initial release date","@type":"Annotation"},"@type":"Date"},{"date":"2016-02-15T19:46:43Z","type":{"value":"modification date","@type":"Annotation"},"@type":"Date"}],"version":"V1","licenses":[{"name":"ICPSR Terms of Use","@type":"License"}],"access":{"landingPage":"10.3886/ICPSR34741.v1","types":[{"value":"download","@type":"Annotation"}],"authorizations":[{"value":"clickLicense","@type":"Annotation"}],"authentications":[null],"@type":"Access"},"conformsTo":[{"name":"DDI","description":"Metadata are prepared using Data Documentation Intitiative Codebook 2.5.","@type":"DataStandard"}],"size":0,"@type":"DatasetDistribution"}],"citationCount":0,"creators":[{"fullName":"Zweig, Janine","firstName":"Janine","lastName":"Zweig","affiliations":[{"name":"Urban Institute","@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"},{"fullName":"Dank, Meredith","firstName":"Meredith","lastName":"Dank","affiliations":[{"name":"Urban Institute","@type":"Organization"}],"@type":"Person"}],"acknowledges":[{"identifier":{"identifier":"2010-WG-BX-0003","identifierSource":"United States Department of Justice.
